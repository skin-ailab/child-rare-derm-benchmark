    "history_and_symptoms": "The patient is an 8-year-old healthy girl who has had recurrent vulvar blisters over the past two months. She didn't have itching, pain, or discharge, nor did she have dysuria, vaginal bleeding, or abnormal secretions. The initial symptoms worsened under emotional stress and improved with oral steroid therapy, but recurred after discontinuation. Physical examination revealed a hypopigmented blister on the left labia minora. In subsequent episodes, symptoms worsened, with severe itching, dysuria, and painful defecation.",
    "examination": "A punch biopsy and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) were performed. Pathology showed subepidermal cleavage, with a few eosinophils and mild lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. DIF showed linear deposits of IgG, IgA, and C3 at the basement membrane zone. Serological tests showed normal levels of BP180 and BP230 antibodies.",
    "treatment": "Initially treated with 0.05% betamethasone valerate ointment, then switched to oral steroids. After reducing oral steroids, oral dapsone was used for maintenance. There was only one recurrence, which was quickly relieved with topical betamethasone.",

Biopsy results showed multiple dermal epithelioid cell granulomas, with histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells, surrounded by lymphocytes, indicative of tuberculoid granulomas. The hypopigmented macule showed multiple small granulomatous aggregates composed of epithelioid cells and lymphocytes, as well as a few scattered multinucleated giant cells, consistent with tuberculid. - Mantoux test: Very strong positive (>20 mm induration at 48 hours), with blister formation at the injection site followed by ulceration. - T-SPOT®.TB: Non-reactive. - Chest radiography: Normal. - Other tests: Including complete blood count, serum biochemistry, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, serum immunoglobulins, abdominal ultrasound, etc., all reported normal.",
